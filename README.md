# Task01 for PRODIGY-SW-01 Build a Temperature Conversion Program
1-This C# program is a user-driven temperature conversion tool. It works as follows:

2-Temperature Input: The program prompts the user to enter a temperature value. If the input isn't a valid number, it keeps asking until the user provides a valid temperature.

3-Unit Input: The program then asks the user to specify the unit of the temperature (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, or K for Kelvin). It continues prompting the user until they provide a valid unit.

4-Conversion: Based on the provided unit, the program converts the temperature to the other two units.

5-Output: Finally, it displays the converted temperatures in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
